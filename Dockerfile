# Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 
# Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
# This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile. When you are done reading this page, refer to the Dockerfile Best Practices for a tip-oriented guide.

# The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context. The buildâ€™s context is the set of files at a specified location PATH or URL. The PATH is a directory on your local filesystem. The URL is a Git repository location.

# The build context is processed recursively. So, a PATH includes any subdirectories and the URL includes the repository and its submodules. This example shows a build command that uses the current directory (.)
